# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carinalak. I live on Ekerö, near Stockholm.
- 👀 I’m interested in listening to, and recording music. I'm a singer and a guitarplayer and you can find some of my songs on Spotify and YouTube as Carina Stars. I also love flowers and gardens and I am a happy owner of an aquarium.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a good Front End Developer, That's really exciting!
- 🔧 In my toolbox I have: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Photoshop and Figma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a lot of interesting projects! Right now it's mostly schoolprojects. 
- 📫 You can reach me on carina.lakosil@gmail.com
- 🔌 My linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carina-lakosil-219a89295/
-  	⚡ Right now it´s pretty empty on my gitHub. That's because I work in my school-gitHub account. I will transfer my work from there as soon as i can.
