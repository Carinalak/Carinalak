# About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carinalak. I live on Ekerö, near Stockholm.
- 👀 I’m interested in listening to, and recording music. I'm a singer and a guitarplayer and you can find some of my songs on Spotify and YouTube as Carina Stars. I also love flowers and gardens and I am a happy owner of an aquarium.

- 🔧 In my toolbox I have: React, Next.js, Vue, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Photoshop, Figma, Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Elements, Styled Components, TailwindCSS, MySQL and MongoDB.
